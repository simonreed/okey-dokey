## Our Club

Riverside FC is a community football club based in the heart of Riverside. Founded in 1923, we've been providing football for players of all ages and abilities for over a century.

Today, we field teams from Under-7s through to our senior first team, alongside our thriving women's section. Our home is Riverside Stadium, a 2,500-capacity ground that has hosted football continuously since 1925.
