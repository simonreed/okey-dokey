## The Early Years (1923-1950)

Riverside FC was founded in 1923 by workers from the Riverside Iron Works, who formed a team to compete in the local works league. The original colours were plain white shirts with black shorts.

In 1925, the club moved to its current home at Riverside Stadium — then a simple roped-off pitch beside the river. The first grandstand was built in 1928 using materials donated by local businesses.

The club joined the Regional League in 1932 and won its first trophy — the County Amateur Cup — in 1937.

## Post-War Growth (1950-1980)

Following World War II, football boomed nationally, and Riverside benefited from increased attendances. The club's record attendance of 3,847 was set in 1957 for an FA Cup tie against Leyton Orient.

The 1960s saw the club struggle financially, and only a supporter-led fundraising campaign saved it from folding in 1968. This led to the formation of the Supporters' Trust, which would later play a crucial role in the club's future.
