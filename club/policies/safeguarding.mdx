## What is Abuse?

Abuse can take many forms:

- **Physical abuse** — hitting, shaking, throwing, burning, or otherwise causing physical harm
- **Emotional abuse** — persistent emotional ill-treatment, bullying, threatening behaviour
- **Sexual abuse** — involving children in sexual activities they don't understand or cannot consent to
- **Neglect** — persistent failure to meet a child's basic needs

## Reporting Concerns

If you have concerns about a child or vulnerable adult:

1. **Don't delay** — report concerns promptly
2. **Contact the Club Welfare Officer** — welfare@riversidefc.com or 07700 900456
3. **Make notes** — record what you've seen or been told, with dates
4. **Don't investigate** — that's for trained professionals

If the concern is about the Welfare Officer, contact the County FA Safeguarding Team.
