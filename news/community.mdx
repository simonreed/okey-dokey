## Community Day Success
**1 February 2026**

Over 200 local children attended our half-term football festival at Riverside Stadium last week. The event, run in partnership with the County FA, provided free coaching sessions, skills challenges, and the chance to meet first-team players.

> "Events like this are at the heart of what we do as a community club. Seeing so many smiling faces on the pitch was brilliant." — **Sophie Turner, Community Director**
