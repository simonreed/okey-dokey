## First Team

### Westfield Athletic 1-3 Riverside FC
**Regional Premier League | 4 February 2026**

A superb away performance saw Riverside climb to third in the table with a comprehensive victory at Valley Road.

After falling behind to an early Westfield goal, the visitors dominated the remainder of the half. Tom Richards equalised from the penalty spot on 35 minutes after Michael Santos was brought down in the box.

The second half was one-way traffic. Santos headed home from a Luke Patterson cross on 58 minutes, before Jack Thompson sealed the win with a stunning 25-yard strike with ten minutes remaining.

> "That's exactly the response we wanted after last week's disappointment. The lads showed real character to come from behind on a difficult pitch." — **David Morrison, Manager**

**Riverside**: Mitchell; Cooper, Williams, O'Brien, Johnson; Hassan, Richards; Patterson, Thompson, Murphy; Santos
